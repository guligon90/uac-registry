# UAC Registry :: Database

## Modelling

In accordance with the functional requsites specified [here](../../docs/pdf/tech_assessment.pdf), there must be three entities:

* **Address**: entity that contains information regarding the address of an user.
* **Client**: a entity that can have multiple users associated with it.
* **User**: a entity that must aggregate credentials for OAuth2 authentication (with JWT). Many users can be related to many addresses,
having one of them as a main address. In respect to the client, a user must be associated to only one client.

### ERD

The Entity Relationship diagram (ERD) for the above entities can be generated via the `devenv` script suite, by running the following command:

```bash
(env) ~/uac-registry/ $ ./scripts/devenv.py erd
```

A file `uac-registry-erd.png` will be generated and saved in `docs/img`. The resulting image is as follows:

## Building and Running

The Docker Compose service, which creates an virtualized instance of the PostgreSQL server, can be built via the `devenv` script suite.
At the terminal, in the project root, execute the command:

```bash
(env) ~/uac-registry/ $ ./scripts/devenv.py build database
```

To run the service, execute:

```bash
(env) ~/uac-registry/ $ ./scripts/devenv.py start database
```

To make sure that the database is running properly, run `docker ps` in the terminal. The output should be something like:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                            PORTS                    NAMES
17f7cf891783        uac-registry-database-image   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   2 hours ago         Up 2 seconds (health: starting)   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   uac-registry-database
```

Alternatively, you can also follow the container logs by running `./scripts/devenv.py logs database`. The output is similar to:
```

```

With the database server up and running, it is time to run the Django migrations, in order to create the SQL database.
To do this, execute:
```bash
(env) ~/uac-registry/ $ ./scripts/devenv.py migrate
```

If, for some reason, the code base for the SQL models have been altered, you must create new migrations. For that, you must run:
```bash
(env) ~/uac-registry/ $ ./scripts/devenv.py make_migrations     # Create new migration files
(env) ~/uac-registry/ $ ./scripts/devenv.py migrate             # To update the SQL structure in the server
```

To stop the container, just run `./scripts/devenv.py stop database`.
